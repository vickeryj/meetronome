A todo list in no particular order

*Limit stop to creator of meeting a cookie might be good enough but a password might also be nice

*Design needs improvement... lots

*Think about slowing down the spin rate for the higher numbers  on expensive meetings (1000$/hr) you don't get much more than a flash when they change.  We might be able to do this with some math.
**A good rule could be if the low digit is spinning faster than one number per frame then let the next highest digit roll continuously 

*Dynamically add digits when the numbers get High,  they should slide in with a Effect

*Cache the DOM objects of the digits (prototype might already be doing this)

*Stopping meetings needs to change the display more.  Maybe it should look like a reciept?

*Change alternatives so they fade in and out.

*Add a small data cache to the alternatives model that gets loaded.  Maybe stored in YML.
